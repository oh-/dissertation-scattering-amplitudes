  A new and novel method of calculating scattering amplitudes is reviewed called
  BCFW recursion relation [@Britto:2005ab]; so named for its authors Ruth Britto,
  Freddy Cachazo, Bo Feng and Edward Witten. It is a useful tool in analysing
  scattering amplitudes, where at each stage of calculation, all interactions
  between particles remain on-shell; eliminating the need to use virtual
  particles.

  MHV vertices are used to explore the method of calculation of gluons, and
  massless particle interactions, and noted that such methods are not limited to
  massless particles, but are versatile in their applications and may be used in
  a wide variety of interactions.
