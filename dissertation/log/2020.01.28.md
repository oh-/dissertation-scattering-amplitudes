## (Looking at dissertation notes)

 - Number equations. eg 1.1 (including section number)
 - Relativistic  \(\to\) Symmetries
 - Clarify notation for Hamiltonian / Lagrangian (\(q,p \to x/\dot{x}\)). Where \(q,p\) is more general.
 - Lorentz Group definition:
    - Set of transformations \(G\) that have the combination of two:
    \[
      a \otimes b \in G \qquad \begin{cases}
        a \in G\\ b \in G
      \end{cases}
    \]
    - Associative
    - \(\exists \one: A \otimes \one = A\)
    - \(\exists A^{-1}: AA^{-1} = \one\)
    - Additional groups looking at side note
    - Invariance of \(x^\mu x_\mu\)
 - Proper and improper groups
 - Restricted group is the important one for our case.
