# Little group and weights

In 1932, Eugene Paul Wigner presented a paeper titled \textit{On unitary
representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group} [see @Wigner:1939aa pp
184-194 Section 6. REDUCTION OF THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE INHOMOGENEOUS
LORENTZ GROUP TO REPRESENTATIONS OF A "LITTLE GROUP"], where he discusses a way
to classify elementary particles by their helicity / spin quantum numbers,
using the a new group he calls the \textit{Little Group}

\begin{definition}[Little group]

Wigners Little group is defined as the subgroup of homogeneous Lorentz Group
that leaves the energy-momentum verctor of a particle invariant:

\begin{equation}
  \tensor{W}{^\mu_\nu} = k^\mu
\end{equation}

\end{definition}


For massless particles (gluons) in 3+1 dimensions; the little group is the
euclidian group \(E(2)\), which is the semi direct product of \(SO)(2)\).

<!--
   - TODO: Is the euclidian group mentioned above, the same as Galilean mechanics?
   - If so, make a mention of what eqation numner we defined it in beforehand
   -->

One can obtain the Little Group as a particular limit of the rotation group
\(SO(3)\)


In 3+1 dimensions, the little group for a massive particle is the rotation group SO(3). On the other hand, for a massless particle, the little group is the Euclidean group E(2) which is a semi-direct product of SO(2) and T(2) - the group of translations in the 2-dimensional plane.
