# Conclusion

The techniques which have been explored here can apply to many theories,
including gravitation.

If we were using Feynman Diagrams, the method would be difficult, but using
this method is much easier.

The generality of this technique is its power.

Thrs technique has been used in collider physics, amplitude techniques - in the
LHC, and even current research in Gravitational waves; where the amplitudes
being measured are black holes, rather than 

The strength of these techniques opens up a broad range of possibilites; comes
a wide range of possibilities.
