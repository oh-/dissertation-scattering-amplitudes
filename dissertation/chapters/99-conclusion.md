# Conclusion

The techniques which have been explored here are versatile in their use and
application.  The generality of this technique is its power, and can be seen
from its usefulness in the decrease in calculations needed when compared to the
same interaction using the Feynman QCD method; and is especially useful when
encountering recursion relations in scattering amplitudes.

They can also be applied to a wide range of applications; for example in
current research it is currently being applied in current and further research
in theories including gravitation; into explicit solutions to \(\mathcal{N} =
4\) supersymmetric recursion relations, and \(\mathcal{N} = 8\) supergravity.

These techniques have been used in accelerator and collider physics, for
example in the LHC, and even current research in Gravitational waves; where the
amplitudes being measured are black holes, rather than particle scattering
amplitudes.
