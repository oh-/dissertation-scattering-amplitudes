Today I had a meeting with Prof. Travaglini. In our meeting we discussed the reading from the previous week, as well as the math question he asked me to cover - which I had noted down with a mistake: where the Lagrangian he had given to me was

$$L = -m\sqrt(1-\dot{x}^2)$$

This had the effect that when calculating the momentum operator  $\left( \hat{p} = \frac{\partial{L}}{\partial \dot{x}}\right)$, we are left with

$$ \hat{H} = \dot{x}p - L = \frac{m \left(- \dot{x}^{2} + \dot{x} + 1\right)}{\sqrt{1 - \dot{x}^{2}}}$$

The suprising result is that the quantity is non-zero.


We discussed the Lorrentz Group, beginning from its definitions as a group:

 - Associatative: $$A(BC) = (AB)C$$
 - Unit: Unit length is 1
 - (something else)

The Lorrentz group has the special characteristic (Orthogonality):

$$\Lambda^{T} \eta \Lambda = \eta$$
