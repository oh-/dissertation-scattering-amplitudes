# Library database introduction seminar.
Today task: We are supposed to write down some relevent keywords related to my current research question.

 * Scattering amplitudes
 * Gluons
 * Guage theory
 *



## Wildcard searches:

 using *, ? and $ to change the way that a search is performed, substituting

  * '*' => 0+ of any character after (eg optic* finds optic, optics, optical ... etc)
  * '?' => 1 charachter (any character, but limited to one).
  * '$' => 0 or 1 of any character (eg colo$r matches both with colour and color)

## Boolean AND or OR  or NOT operators

 * 'AND' inclusive A and B
 * 'OR' exclusive A or B without (AB)
 * 'NOT' excludative A that is not B, and B that is not A.

Boolean operators can be exteded with brackets, to further filter for a specific need.
