In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), a scattering amplitude is the mechanism for predicting and measurements of fundamental particle interactions. Traditionally, they have been computed by mapping the energy associated with each entering particle to exiting particles while preserving at the macro level Einsteins energy-momentum relationship of $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.

This relation is held by keeping tally of the energy momentum relation, and summing all the interactions that take place.


Feynman diagrams are the most common method used to keep tally of the energy and momenta of all particles in an interaction. Each entering particle will have a certain number associated with it with respect to the quantity, as will exiting particles. The computation method involves creating and counting interim interactions joining the entering particle to an exiting particle, while preserving the energy momentum relation.

In Feynman diagrams, the interim particles are allowed to temporarily break such relations - creating a virtual particle; where the interaction is called an **off-shell** @Hodges:2013aa. But as a system, the broken symmetries must cancel each other out by the final exiting particle.

When a virtual particle breaks the energy-momentum relationship, the calculation is said to be 'off-shell'.

This method is rigorous, and good for simple particle interactions, however

it turns out that beyond the simplest examples the complexity of the Feynman diagrammatic computation quickly gets out of hand

Graph that out and you get a parabolic surface for massive particles, and a cone for massless particles, like photons. This is known as the mass shell. The momentum of a real particle can be represented by a vector lying along the shells’ surface. The point is that real particles have momentum vectors that are on the shell – not inside it, but on it.


. This is a null point, as it is only a temporary mater, where by the final interaction, the interaction will cancel each other out, and we are left with so called "on-shell" particles.
