## Scattering Amplitudes

In Quantum Field Theory (QFT), a scattering amplitude is the method of measuring all fundamental particle interactions. It is calcuated by doing the summation of all interactions, mapping all entering particles to all exiting particles while preserving at the macro level the Einstein relationship of $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$.

## Off Shell Feynman Diagrams

Traditionally, Feynman diagrams have been used to calculate such interactions, which map all incoming to outgoing particles, and allow for such interactions to create temporary, or _virtual_ particles, which temporarily break symmetry laws along the path. This method of is called Off-Shell, or more formally, off the mass shell (more on this later)
. This is a null point, as it is only a temporary mater, where by the final interaction, the interaction will cancel each other out, and we are left with so called "on-shell" particles.
