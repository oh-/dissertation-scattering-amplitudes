In order to begin understanding scattering amplitudes, we behin at the fundamental rules of physical systems, and their Interactions.

The language we need to build up the form of relativistic interactions is bootstrapped from classical mechanics, which don't take into account things like the finite speed of light.

A working through the formalism to arrive at the relativistic formalisms for

Let us first take a look at the Lagrangian equation, and how they differ from their relativistic to non-relativistic formulations.

 - in order to account for rel physics, we need to introduce some changes. These changes are explored in the following:

## The changes in the Lagrangian $L$ and Hamiltonian $H$

Understanding interactions between free particles through, we inspect their classical form

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Lg_{\text{NR}} &= \frac{1}{2} m\dvec{x} &&\to& \Lg_{\text{Rel}} &= -m\sqrt{1-\dvec{x}^2}\\
  H_{\text{NR}} &= \frac{\vec{p}^2}{2m}+V(x) &&\to& H_{Rel} &= (something)
\end{aligned}
$$

To calculate this relation, we inspect the Lagrangian relation between its two component measurables (in an unspecific basis, these can be any two variables $\vec{p}, \vec{q}$, but to relate them to the classical equations involving momentum and position, we will be calling them $\vec{p}, \vec{x}$ )

$$
  p \equiv \pdv{\Lg}{\dvec{x}} = \frac{m\dvec{x}}{\sqrt{1-\dvec{x}^2}}
$$

For small velocities, where $\vec{x}\ll 1$, we can say:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lagrange_smallapprox}
  \sqrt{1-\dvec{x}^2} \approx 1-\frac{\dvec{x}^2}{2} + \dots
\end{equation}


## The time evolution of the system

Where $\H = \H(\vec{q}, \vec{p},t)$

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lagrangian_timeevolutionp}
  \dv{\vec{p}}{t} = -\pdv{\H}{\vec{q}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lagrangian_timeevolutionq}
  \dv{\vec{q}}{t} = +\pdv{\H}{\vec{p}}
\end{equation}

Thus leaving us with the following set of equations:

$\H = T+V$:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hamiltonian_lagrangian_basic}
  \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hamiltonian_lagrangian}
  \H = \sum_i{\dvec{q}^i\pdv{\L}{\dvec{q}^i} -\L} = \sum_i{\dvec{q}^ip_i-\L}
\end{equation}

where

$$
p_i = \pdv{\L}{\dvec{q}^i}
$$

leading to
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \H &= m\dvec{x}^2 - (-m\sqrt{1-\dvec{x}^2})\\
  &= \frac{m\dvec{x}}{\sqrt{1-\dvec{x}^2}}\dvec{x} +m\sqrt{1-\dvec{x}^2} \\
  &= \frac{m\dvec{x}+m-m\dvec{x}^2}{\sqrt{1-\dvec{x}^2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Einstein Equation

Where we arrive at Einsteins formula, when setting c = 1
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein}
  \H = E = \frac{m}{\sqrt{1-\dvec{x}^2}}
\end{equation}

This explains the principal of relatively according to Einsteins equations, and allows us to begin setting up the formalism for representing interactions which include relativistic properties.

## Principal of relativity

(Classical theory of fields, @Landau:1975aa )
Inertial reference frame in which a body moves in respect to and without any other force enacting on it, proceeds at constant velocity.


### Reference frames:

Two inertial reference frames are related by:

$$
  \Delta x = x-x'
$$

where $\dv{x}{t}=0 \to x$ and $x'$ have same property of inertiality.


### Intervals:

Event: described by the place where it occured and times

$$
\begin{aligned}
  e_1 &= [t,x,y,z]\\
  \text{worldline }&= [t\to t', f(x,y,z)-f'(x,y,z)]
\end{aligned}
$$
