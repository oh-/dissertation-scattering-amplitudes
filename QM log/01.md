# TASKS:

  [x] Make preliminary meeting with Prof. Gabriele Travaglini (26th Sept)
  [x] Read Scientific American Paper; 'Loops, Trees and the search for new physics'.
  [] Read Landau and Lifschitz, section 1-3
  [] Lagrangian calculation $\hat{H}$ and $p_x$ from $L = -m\sqrt(1-x^2)$

# Lagrangian calculation

Given the following:
$$L = -m\sqrt(1-x^2)$$
Calculate $\hat{H}$ and $p_x$:

## $p_x$:

$$
	p_x = \frac{\partial L}{\Partial \dot{x}}\\
	 = 0
$$

## $\hat{H}$:

$$
	\hat{H} = \Sum_{i}{x_i p_i - L}\\
	 = \dot{x}p - L\\
	 = 0 - (-m\sqrt{1-x^2})\\
	 = m\sqrt{1-x^2}\\
$$

# Monday 23/9/2019

I went to the introduction class, where we were told how the course will be run,
and the expectations on us. We need to fill in our Risk assessment form.

# Thursday

Meeting with Prof. Travaglini.

In out initial meeting, we talked about Amplitudes Covered some basic math,
including Lagrangians mechanics. I was introduced to some of the people who are
researching in the field at Queen Mary.  Research is exploring Higgs particle,
Scattering amplitudes in guage throries, massless particles, amplitudes for
n-Gluon scattering, and Helicity.

Introduction to topic, and name of Project: **Everything you ever wanted to know about scattering Amplitudes (But were too afraid to ask)**
 - (with a task to complete before next time we meet) I was given some reading material: *Qnantum Physics; Loops, trees and the
 - search for new physics*, Scientific American
